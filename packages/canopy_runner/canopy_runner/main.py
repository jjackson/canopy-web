"""Runner main loop (CDP executor).

One iteration (run_once):
  1. preflight emdash's CDP health — unhealthy => degraded heartbeat, skip the
     claim (queued turns wait rather than being claimed-then-burned), still poll
     the inbox + fire schedules so inbound work keeps enqueuing
  2. heartbeat (with the macOS host, for session-reuse ownership)
  3. report the open emdash sessions the phone can continue (throttled)
  4. claim at most one queued turn and route it to an emdash session (reuse or
     create) via execute.execute_turn

Turns finish synchronously — the runner owns the routing lifecycle; the work
continues in the visible emdash session — so there is NO injection state to track
and NO emdash-DB write. The only emdash-DB access is the two READ-ONLY queries in
`emdash.py` (task_state, list_open_sessions), whose column dependencies are
verified out-of-band by `canopy_runner verify-emdash`.

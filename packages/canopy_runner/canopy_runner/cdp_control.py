The runner drives emdash through its real UI over CDP — the sanctioned path that
supersedes DB injection + app patching. This module shells out to

`cd canopy_runner/cdp && npm install`.

    restarts each way in a day). SessionLink.reusable_by() compares this value by string
    EQUALITY, so every flap silently orphaned every link recorded under the other name:
    resolve returned reuse=false, each thread got a fresh cold session, and nothing was
    logged anywhere. Proved by experiment — one restart flipped the same live link from
    reuse=true to reuse=false with nothing else changed.

    So pin the FIRST value computed and reuse it forever. Still human-readable in the
    runner list (unlike a raw UUID), but stable. The pin lives under the account's own
    home, which is exactly the ownership semantic emdash needs: sessions are
    per-macOS-account, so two accounts get two ids and one account always gets one.

    Pre-existing links recorded under the other name self-heal: one create each, then
    stable. An unwritable pin degrades to the live value — flappy, but no worse.

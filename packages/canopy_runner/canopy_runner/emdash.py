"""Emdash sqlite adapter — READ-ONLY.

The CDP executor drives emdash's real UI (create/reuse sessions); it never writes
to emdash's DB. But the DOM cannot answer "does this task still exist?" — emdash
virtualizes the sidebar, so a scrolled-out task is absent from the page — so the
reuse decision asks sqlite instead (`task_state`), and the phone's session list is
read the same way (`list_open_sessions`).

`task_state` is deliberately **fail-soft**: any sqlite error degrades to "unknown"
rather than raising, because a read failure must never be mistaken for "session gone"
(that false negative duplicated a live session — see its docstring). `list_open_sessions`
is fail-soft only for a MISSING db ("no emdash here"); a real read failure raises
`EmdashReadError` instead, because the caller (the phone's session report) must not
mistake "could not read" for "zero open sessions" — reporting an empty list clears
every RunnerBinding server-side. The risk both reads share is a *silent* schema drift —
emdash renaming a column these queries name — which is why `check_read_schema`
(surfaced as `canopy_runner verify-emdash`) exists: run it after an emdash update to
confirm the columns these two functions depend on still exist. Keep `READ_SCHEMA` in
lockstep with the SQL below — it IS the list of columns the SQL names.

    emdash VIRTUALIZES the sidebar, so a task scrolled out of view isn't in the page at
    all — indistinguishable, to a DOM query, from a task that never existed. That false

    "unknown" (missing/unreadable/drifted DB) is deliberately distinct from "absent": a
    read failure must never be mistaken for "gone", or we're back to duplicating live
    sessions. Callers degrade to the CDP verdict on "unknown" — see execute.execute_turn.

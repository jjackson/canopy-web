"""Read the recent message tail of a live emdash session's Claude transcript.

Phase B of the emdash session controller (docs/superpowers/specs/
2026-07-16-emdash-session-controller-design.md). STDLIB ONLY — the runner is
Django-free and cannot import apps.session_sharing.parser; this is the runner's
own minimal tail reader (user/assistant text for the last ~8 messages), not the
full ParsedTurn model the server uses.

emdash stores no conversation content in emdash4.db (the `messages` table is
empty); the content lives in Claude Code's transcript .jsonl under
~/.claude/projects/<encoded-worktree>/<session>.jsonl. There is no session id or
path in the DB, so the transcript is resolved by CONVENTION:

    worktree  = ~/emdash/worktrees/<repo>/emdash/<task>[-<suffix>]   (see below)
    proj dir  = ~/.claude/projects/<worktree with '/' and '.' -> '-'>
    file      = newest *.jsonl in that dir

The convention has two real-world wrinkles the naive path missed (both verified
against the live fleet, 2026-07-20): emdash appends a short random de-dupe suffix
to the worktree dir name (`-cysov`), and the layout is not uniform — some
worktrees sit at `<repo>/<task>` with no `emdash` segment. `resolve_transcript`
handles both by prefix-globbing each candidate base and accepting a `-<suffix>`
tail; the prefix stays anchored at the parent segment so one task can't grab
another's transcript.

A wrong path is a silent wrong-answer, so resolution returns None rather than
guess. Nothing here raises: a missing dir, unreadable file, or malformed line
degrades to an empty tail with a reason string, so the poll tick survives.

# --ws-ping-interval 5: uvicorn sends a WebSocket ping every 5s. This IS the idle
# keepalive for long-lived sockets (runner control channel, supervisor + turn
# tails): the server→client traffic keeps the shared ALB from idle-closing the
# connection, and clients auto-pong. Proven live: a fully idle WS holds 90s+ with
# only these pings. (The earlier erratic ~5-10s drops were NOT the proxy — they
# were the channels_redis layer's blocking reads timing out on ElastiCache and
# killing the consumer; fixed by moving the single-task channel layer to InMemory.
# See config/settings/connectlabs.py.) --ws-ping-timeout 20 closes a peer that
# stops ponging.

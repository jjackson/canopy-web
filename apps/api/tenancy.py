"""Tenant (workspace) resolution for the /api surface.

Scoped routers are mounted ONCE, flat (``/api/agents/...``) — that keeps the
OpenAPI schema single + clean. The canonical tenant URL ``/api/w/{ws}/agents/...``
is served by this middleware, which:

  * verifies the caller is a member of ``{ws}`` (non-member → 404, no leak),
  * stashes ``request.workspace_slug = ws``,
  * strips the ``/w/{ws}`` segment so the request reroutes to the flat mount.

Legacy flat ``/api/agents/...`` calls (existing PAT / plugin callers) fall
through untouched: ``workspace_slug`` stays ``None`` and the handler applies its
pre-tenancy default-workspace logic (non-breaking).

Handlers read ``getattr(request, "workspace_slug", None)``: truthy pins the
tenant; ``None`` means flat/compat.

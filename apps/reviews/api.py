"""Django Ninja v2 router for the reviews surface.

Endpoints:
  GET    /api/reviews/            — list all review requests (DDD-plans dashboard)
  POST   /api/reviews/            — create a review_request (orchestrator → server)
  GET    /api/reviews/<id>/       — poll for status (orchestrator) / show to human
  POST   /api/reviews/<id>/submit/ — human submits decisions + narration edits
  DELETE /api/reviews/<id>/       — delete a review request (dashboard cleanup)

Auth strategy: the same PAT Bearer flow used everywhere else in canopy-web.
The canopy-side orchestrator mints a Personal Access Token (via manage.py
create_token) and sends `Authorization: Bearer <raw>` on every call.
BearerTokenAuthMiddleware resolves the token to a real Django user, so all
three endpoints see an authenticated request.user — no special allowlist
hacks needed. The human review page uses the same session_auth (already
logged in via Google OAuth) or, if visibility=="link", the review is readable
by anyone with the URL (no ?t= token required).

"""Timeline source for DDD: rendered runs + narrative-review checkpoints.

Two ``kind``s under the ``ddd`` subsystem:

- ``run`` — a render (a ``run_id`` with artifacts). Sorted by the latest
  artifact/review timestamp in the run; links to the run package.
- ``narrative_review`` — a story-bearing review version (the narrative-agreement
  gate). Sorted by ``resolved_at`` (when decided) else ``created_at``; links to
  the review surface.

Reuses the read-time join helpers in :mod:`apps.runs.aggregate` so this stays
consistent with the /ddd views.

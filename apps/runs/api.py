"""Django Ninja v2 router for the DDD run views (read-only aggregation).

Mounted at ``/api/ddd``. A *narrative* is the run_id slug; runs roll up under
it. Everything here joins ``Walkthrough`` + ``ReviewRequest`` on ``run_id`` at
read time — see ``apps/runs/aggregate.py``. Team-internal: any authenticated
user (session or PAT) reads everything, same rule as the reviews dashboard.

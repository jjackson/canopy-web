"""Per-user write rate limiting for mutating MCP tools.

Mutating tools (e.g. clear_insights) can do real damage, so we cap how
often a single user may call them. The limit is enforced against the
Django cache: a sliding fixed-window counter keyed by user + bucket.

Default: 10 writes per 60s per user. Tune via settings:
    MCP_WRITE_LIMIT (int), MCP_WRITE_WINDOW_SECONDS (int).

"""Registry + merge for the team activity timeline.

Each entry points at a ``recent_events(*, limit, before, user)`` callable living
in a subsystem's own ``timeline.py``. The aggregator calls the enabled sources,
merges their events, sorts newest-first, and slices to ``limit``. A source that
raises is logged and skipped — one broken subsystem never blanks the whole feed.

No new tables: every source reads live models at request time. Each source
returns at most ``limit`` events (and only events older than ``before`` when a
cursor is given), so worst-case work is ``len(sources) * limit`` rows.

"""The decision->work edge: an approved Item becomes Turns.

`dispatch[]` was never a new concept — it is a deferred Turn enqueue. Ada's
`{target_agent, prompt, origin, origin_ref}`, the phone composer's
`{agent_slug, prompt, origin}`, and Turn are three spellings of one payload.
TurnSpec is that payload, named once.

    `actor_workspace_slugs` is the deciding human's workspace memberships. A
    cross-agent dispatch (`target_agent` set) is authorized ONLY if the target's
    workspace is one of them — the hard tenant boundary. This preserves the fleet
    manager (Ada dispatching hal→eva across workspaces works when the human driving
    it is a member of both), while blocking a single-workspace user from landing a
    prompt on another tenant's agent.

    Raises ValueError for an unknown OR cross-tenant target_agent rather than
    skipping it: an approved item whose work silently never happens is the worst
    outcome here. The caller (services.decide_item) runs this inside the same
    transaction as the decision, so a raise rolls the decision back and leaves the
    item OPEN and retryable — rather than stranding it decided-but-undispatched,
    which deciding once (409) would make permanent.

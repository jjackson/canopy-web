    # any turn and their turns sat QUEUED indefinitely. This also makes the rule
    # agree with _runner_schedule_qs, which already derives tenancy this way.
    #
    # Still a real boundary, and the b4f5ead exploit stays closed: paired_by is
    # server-assigned from request.user at pairing, so unlike capabilities it is
    # not attacker-controlled. An outsider pairing a runner that declares a
    # victim's agent slug gets only THEIR OWN workspaces, so the victim's agent
    # stays unclaimable. Conversely a runner paired by someone who is a member of
    # a workspace may claim its agents' turns — that human can already drive those

        it could not unwedge anything — it would only destroy work still owed
        (laptop offline over a weekend must not retire Friday's slot). Retiring
        a stale queued occurrence is supersede_open_turns' job, at the right
        moment.
      - created_at measures *owed* time, so a turn queued longer than grace would
        be born past-grace and get aborted on its first sweep after being claimed
        — killing live human work in the function meant to protect it.
    claimed_at is non-null for every EXECUTING turn: claim_next_turn writes it,

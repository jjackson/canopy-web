    """Schedules this runner may see, gated by TENANT — never by capabilities.

    capabilities is a caller-supplied routing hint declared at pairing and never
    validated (see b4f5ead, Critical): scoping by it would let anyone pair a
    runner declaring a victim's agent slug and read that agent's schedules,
    leaking `prompt`. The workspace is the boundary.

    The tenant is derived from `paired_by` — the human who paired the runner —
    rather than the Runner.workspace FK, because paired_by is server-assigned at
    pairing (request.user), so the FIELD is not attacker-controlled.

    That last point is necessary but NOT sufficient, and reading it alone is how
    this route was first shipped vulnerable. Deriving the tenant from an
    unspoofable field on a row the ATTACKER SELECTED buys nothing: runner_id is
    a caller-supplied query param, so choosing whose paired_by gets read is as
    good as spoofing it. The real invariant needs both halves — the tenant
    derives from paired_by AND _runner_or_404 pins the runner to request.user,
    so the row and the field are alike server-controlled.

    claim_next_turn NOW DERIVES THE SAME WAY (agent.workspace ∈
    workspaces(paired_by), or IS NULL), so the two rules AGREE: every schedule
    this runner may fire produces a turn that same runner may claim.

    They briefly diverged, and the divergence was an outage, not a nicety.
    claim_next_turn shipped scoped to the Runner.workspace FK while this
    predicate derived from paired_by — so a runner homed to `alpha` whose pairer
    also belongs to `beta` could SEE and FIRE beta's schedules here but could not
    CLAIM the resulting turns, leaving them QUEUED forever. Because one laptop
    runner serves a fleet that deliberately spans workspaces, that stopped 4 of 5
    production agents from executing at all. The resolution was to converge the
    CLAIM onto paired_by (this predicate's rule), NOT to narrow this one onto the
    FK: the FK records where a runner lives, not who it may work for.

    NULL paired_by fails closed below (none()), which is stricter than
    _runner_visibility_q's legacy-ungated allowance — an orphaned runner can be
    operated, but can never sync or fire a schedule.

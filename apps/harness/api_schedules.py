"""Django Ninja router for /api/agents/{slug}/schedules — the human-facing CRUD
for recurring turns.

Deliberately separate from api.py: that module is the machine control plane
(runner pairing, claim, lease), this one is the supervisor's editing surface.
Mounted on the /agents namespace exactly as agent_runs already is, so the
tenant path /api/w/{ws}/agents/... works via WorkspaceResolveMiddleware.

The handlers are thin: they resolve + serialize via schedule_services (the
request-free layer the MCP tools also call, so the two surfaces can't drift),
mapping its domain exceptions to HTTP — ScheduleNotFound -> 404, and
DuplicateScheduleName -> the repo's 409 uniqueness convention. The savepoint +
supersede logic lives in the service, so these handlers no longer touch the ORM.

"""Stub executor — the SP2a stand-in for the SP2b cloud runner.

A real cloud runner will CLAIM a queued session turn (claim_next_turn), start it,
run `claude -p`, and append the real assistant/tool stream to the ledger. Until
that lands (it needs a deployed ECS service + a claude binary), this drives the
same transitions in-process with a canned reply, so the whole send -> Turn ->
execute -> ledger -> Message projection -> live tail loop is exercisable now.

It appends the SAME event kinds the real runner will, so nothing downstream (the
projection, SP1's realtime tail) has to change when the stub is swapped out.

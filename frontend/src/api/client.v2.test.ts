// Regression test for the workspace-rewrite middleware eating request bodies.

// The middleware used to rebuild the rewritten request via
// `new Request(url, request)`. That constructor form adopts the source
// Request's body as a *live stream*, which consumes/disturbs it — so every
// workspace-scoped POST/PATCH/PUT died at the network layer with
// "TypeError: Failed to fetch" before it ever left the browser (no response,
// no status). A test that only checks the rewritten URL would NOT have
// caught this — the URL rewrite was always correct; only the body died.

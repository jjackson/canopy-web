"""Django settings for canopy-web deployed to the connect-labs AWS environment.

canopy-web runs as the third tenant on labs.connect.dimagi.com:
  - connect-labs (the primary) at the root
  - ace-web at /ace
  - canopy-web at /canopy   ← this

Inherits production security; configures for ALB TLS termination, the /canopy
path prefix, tenant-unique path-scoped cookies, the shared RDS (canopy_web DB),
and the shared ElastiCache Redis (cache now; Channels layer lands with W4).
Mirrors ace-web's connectlabs.py.

# Channel layer = InMemory, NOT Redis, and this is deliberate.
#
# This service runs a SINGLE ECS task with a SINGLE uvicorn process (DesiredCount=1,
# no --workers). Every WebSocket consumer AND every group-send publisher (turn
# enqueue → wake, chat → interject) lives in that one process, so an in-process
# layer is all the coordination that's needed — and it is the layer the Channels
# docs recommend for a single process.
#
# The Redis channel layer (channels_redis) actively BROKE long-lived WebSockets
# here: its consumer receive loop does a blocking read against the shared
# ElastiCache, and on an idle connection that read raises
# `redis.exceptions.TimeoutError: Timeout reading from …` up through
# channels.utils.await_many_dispatch, which tears the socket down. That produced
# erratic ~5-10s disconnects on every realtime surface (runner control channel,
# supervisor + turn tails) that looked like a proxy idle-timeout but was not — the
# shared ALB holds long connections fine (connect-labs' long-running workflows
# prove it). Redis bought us nothing here (nothing to coordinate across) and cost
# us the whole feature.
#
# SCALING CAVEAT: InMemory does not cross processes. If this service ever runs more
# than one web task (or uvicorn --workers > 1), a runner connected to task A would
# not receive a wake published by task B. At that point restore a Redis channel
# layer — but configure it with connection health so idle reads don't kill sockets:
#   "hosts": [{"address": _REDIS_URL, "health_check_interval": 30,
#             "socket_keepalive": True, "retry_on_timeout": True}]
# Redis stays the Django CACHE backend above (request-scoped reads, never a
# long-lived blocking pop — unaffected by this).

# stays QUEUED for a session-capable runner (e.g. the laptop emdash daemon), which
# drives the agent's emdash session and bridges the reply back to the ledger — so the
# website streams the actual agent response and you can continue a session from your
# phone. If no session-capable runner is online, the turn simply waits (rather than
# getting an instant fake reply). See apps/canopy_sessions/executor.py + packages/canopy_runner

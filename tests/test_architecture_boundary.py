"""Architecture boundary test — enforces the framework→product one-way rule.

The dependency arrow is one-way: FRAMEWORK code (the generic, agent-agnostic
substrate any agent could reuse) never imports PRODUCT code (canopy's own domain
features). PRODUCT may freely import FRAMEWORK. This is the invariant that keeps
the blend "cuttable" — see ARCHITECTURE.md for tier definitions and the rationale
behind every carve-out below.

This test is the machine-checkable shadow of ARCHITECTURE.md (Wave 0 of the
framework harvest). Pure stdlib `ast` — no Django setup, no new dependency.

If it fails you have two honest options:
  (a) you put product code in a framework app  → move it to a product app, or
  (b) you added a genuinely new allowed seam   → document it in ARCHITECTURE.md
      and add it to COMPOSITION_ROOT / ALLOWED_FILES below WITH a reason.
Never silence a violation by reclassifying an app just to make this pass.
